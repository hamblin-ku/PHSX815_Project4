# PHSX815 Project 4
## Spin Measurment Experiment
### Description:
For this project, I sample from a categorical distribution to simulate spin measurements of a fermion (specifically a lepton).

### Usage
All python scripts can be ran from the command line with the `-h` or `--help` flags to display all the options.
