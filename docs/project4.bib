	shorttitle = {Quantum/Classical Interface},
	abstract = {Although intrinsic spin is usually viewed as a purely quantum property with no classical analog, we present evidence here that fermion spin has a classical origin rooted in the geometry of three-dimensional physical space. Our approach to the quantum/classical interface is based on a formulation of relativistic classical mechanics that uses spinors. Spinors and projectors arise naturally in the Clifford's geometric algebra of physical space and not only provide powerful tools for solving problems in classical electrodynamics, but also reproduce a number of quantum results. In particular, many properites of elementary fermions, as spin-1/2 particles, are obtained classically and relate spin, the associated g-factor, its coupling to an external magnetic field, and its magnetic moment to Zitterbewegung and de Broglie waves. The relationship is further strengthened by the fact that physical space and its geometric algebra can be derived from fermion annihilation and creation operators. The approach resolves Pauli's argument against treating time as an operator by recognizing phase factors as projected rotation operators.},
